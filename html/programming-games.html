<h1>Programming Games</h1>
<p>
A list of Programming Games, Learning Games, Programming Learning Environments and similar stuff.
Descriptions taken from the respective sites.
</p>

<h2>I Multiplayer Programming Games</h2>
<p>
Multiplayer Programming Games in the spirit of Darwin and CoreWars. Several contestants develop AI agents and compete in a tournament.
</p>


<h3>Crobots</h3>
<p>
"Unlike arcade type games which require human inputs controlling some object, all strategy in <a target="_blank" href="http://crobots.deepthought.it/home.php">CROBOTS</a> must be complete before the actual game begins. Game strategy is condensed into a C language program that you design and write. Your program controls a robot whose mission is to seek out, track, and destroy other robots, each running different programs. Each robot is equally equipped, and up to four robots may compete at once. CROBOTS is best played among several people, each refining their own robot program, then matching program against program."
</p>

<h3>Robot Game</h3>
<p>
"<a target="_blank" href="https://robotgame.net">Robot Game</a> is a competitive game played with programs. Code an AI to control robots in python. Challenge others in unranked matches. The server automatically queues ranked matches."
</p>

<h3>BerryBots</h3>
<p>
"<a target="_blank" href="http://berrybots.com">BerryBots</a> is a programming game. Ships and stages are programmed in Lua and run on Mac, Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, or on the web at <a target="_blank" href="http://PlayBerryBots.com">PlayBerryBots.com</a>. Every stage is different. The sample stages include mazes, jousting, a race track, arcade games, and battle stages. And it's easy to program your own."
</p>

<h3>trAInsported</h3>
<p>
"<a target="_blank" href="http://trainsportedgame.no-ip.org">trAInsported</a> is a game about trains, Artificial Intelligence and lots and lots of passengers. It's the near future, and trains are controlled by AI. It's your job to write the best AI on the market. Manage your trains in short rounds and make sure you transport more passengers than any other company."
</p>

<h3>AntMe!</h3>
<p>
"<a target="_blank" href="http://www.antme.net/en/">AntMe!</a> is a free, fun game that teaches players object-oriented programming. It's easy to pick up, it's exciting, and despite being a game, it's very relevant to real-world applications. You control your very own ant colony using real, professional code. You teach your ants how to master many challenges, like how to gather sugar and apples, how to defend their anthill and how to defeat the natural enemies of ants and programmers alike: bugs."
</p>

<h3>Ruby Warrior</h3>
<p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior">Ruby Warrior</a> "is a game designed to teach the Ruby language and artificial intelligence in a fun, interactive way. You play as a warrior climbing a tall tower to reach the precious Ruby at the top level. On each floor you need to write a Ruby script to instruct the warrior to battle enemies, rescue captives, and reach the stairs. You have some idea of what each floor contains, but you never know for certain what will happen. You must give the Warrior enough artificial intelligence up-front to find his own way."</p>
